# camcap
C++ header file for (web) camera capture.
Windows-only so far.

# desc
This header-only code allows you to grab frame information from a connected video input device (webcam for example).

The idea is to provide a generic API and specific implementations for DirectShow, Windows Media Capture (Win10) and/or Windows Media Foundation (WinVista/7).
